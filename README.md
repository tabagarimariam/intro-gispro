## Overview

GIS (Geographic Information Systems) programming combines the power of geographic data with programming to analyze and visualize spatial information. This repository serves as a practical companion to the book, providing hands-on examples to help you grasp the concepts discussed.

Whether you are a beginner or an experienced programmer, these examples will guide you through various GIS programming techniques using Python. 

## Topics Covered

This repository focuses on the following key topics:

- **GeoPython**: Learn how to manipulate geospatial data using Python libraries.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Understand the principles of analyzing spatial data.
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Use Jupyter for interactive coding and data visualization.
- **Mapping**: Create maps to visualize geographic data effectively.
- **Python**: Get comfortable with Python programming as it relates to GIS.

## Getting Started

To get started with the code examples, you will need to have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the official website: [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

After installing Python, you can set up your environment by following these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tabagarimariam/intro-gispro.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd intro-gispro
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Code Examples

The code examples are organized into folders based on the topics covered in the book. Each folder contains Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts that demonstrate specific concepts.

### Example 1: Basic Mapping

In this example, you will learn how to create a simple map using the `folium` library. 

```python
import folium

# Create a map centered at a specific location
map = folium.Map(location=[45.5236, -122.6750], zoom_start=13)

# Add a marker
folium.Marker([45.5236, -122.6750], popup='Portland').add_to(map)

# Save the map to an HTML file
map.save('map.html')
```

### Example 2: Geocoding with Geopy

This example demonstrates how to convert addresses into geographic coordinates using the `geopy` library.

```python
from geopy.geocoders import Nominatim

# Initialize the geocoder
geolocator = Nominatim(user_agent="geoapiExercises")

# Get location
location = geolocator.geocode("1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, CA")
print((location.latitude, location.longitude))
```

## Installation

To run the examples in this repository, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

You can install Jupyter Notebook using pip:

```bash
pip install notebook
```

## Usage

To use the code examples, open a Jupyter Notebook in the terminal:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Navigate to the directory where the examples are stored and open any notebook. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the code and see the results.
